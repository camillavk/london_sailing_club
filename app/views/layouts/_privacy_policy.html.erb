          This document outlines our general policy and practices for the information we collect, how we use it and the notice and choice you have regarding our use of and your ability to correct that information.
        </br>
        </br>
          Our overriding principles are:
        </br>
          We will never sell, rent, or give away any of your personal information without your consent.
          We do not presume that you are granting us permission to share your personal information with third parties.
          Whenever it becomes necessary to share some of your personal information with third parties, we will ask you for your explicit consent.
          When you use our website, anonymized connection data is collected for the sole purpose of monitoring our services (for example, analyzing errors, preventing abuse, quality assurance and optimizations). The collected data includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, information about your web browser and how you use our website (for example, the pages you visit). Where we use services supplied by third parties (e.g. Amazon AWS, CloudFlare) that have similar needs to monitor their operations, we will ensure that their policies are compatible with ours.
        </br>
        </br>
          We use ‘cookies’ in compliance with this privacy policy to provide a better service to our users. See our Cookies Information for details.
        </br>
        </br>
          When you access our Member’s Section, we require you to authenticate yourself using your account at the Meetup.com website. We use the information provided by Meetup to establish your identity and provide you with personalized services. Your relationship with Meetup and our use of the Meetup Application Programming Interface (API) is regulated by the Meetup Terms of Service Agreement.
        </br>
        </br>
          If we require additional data, we will, at the time of collection, explain to you why we need the data, how we process it and who we make it available to.
        </br>
        </br>
          You have, at any time, the right to obtain a copy of all your personal information we have on file. Whenever possible, we will give you an opportunity to review, change or delete your personal data online. Where this isn’t possible or impractical, you can request updates or deletion by contacting us directly.
        </br>
        </br>
          If we do need to change any aspect of this policy, we will post those changes together with the date these changes came into effect.
